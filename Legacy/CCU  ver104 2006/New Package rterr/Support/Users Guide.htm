<FONT SIZE=2>This program was designed to convert New Jersey State plane
coordinates (NAD83) to latitude and longitude (NAD27 and NAD83). The geographic
area for which this conversion will work is bounded on the east by longitude
73&#176; 37' 30" and on the west by 75&#176; 37" 30". It is bounded on the
south by latitude 38&#176; 45' 00" and on the north by 41&#176; 22' 30".
This conversion is for the horizontal coordinates and does not address the
vertical coordinate. </FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><B>State Plane Coordinates (Easting &amp; Northing)</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>State plane coordinates are NAD83 datum points. The easting
and northing are to be entered in US survey feet with up to three decimal
places.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><B>Geographic Coordinates (Latitude &amp; Longitude)</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Latitude and longitude can be in either NAD27 or NAD83. They
can be entered as either decimal degrees or as degrees, minutes, and decimal
seconds. If entered as decimal degrees at least five decimal places should
be entered. If entered as degrees, minutes, and decimal seconds the value
needs to be entered without spaces between the units and with leading zeros
in the minutes and seconds for values less than ten. Up to three decimal
places may be entered. The longitude is always entered as a positive value
without a leading zero.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><B>Atlas Sheet Coordinates</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Atlas Sheet coordinate is a seven-digit number. All seven-digits
must be entered. Entry is controlled by the use of a mask. The second pair
of digits, which represent a specific block on the atlas sheet, must be entered
with a leading zero for blocks one through five. These coordinates are based
on NAD27 so the latitude and longitude generated are NAD27.</FONT>
<P>
<B><SMALL>Batch Conversion</SMALL> </B>
<P>
The batch allows for the input of state plane, latitude/longitude, or atlas
sheet coordinates for conversion. The file to be converted must be an ASCII
delimited text file. The format of the file for converting state plane or
latitude/longitude is <FONT COLOR="Red"><B>Id, Y-coordinate (Northing or
Latitude), X-coordinate (Easting or
Longitude)</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="Black">. </FONT>
<P>
Example: 3164855, 368154.62, 312006.32
<P>
The format of the file for converting atlas sheet coordinates&nbsp;(ASC)
is <FONT COLOR="Red"><B>Id, ASC</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="Black">.</FONT> The
ASC coordinate must have a seperators between the Sheet Number, Block Number
and Rectangle Number.
<P>
Example: 3164855, 31:02:229
<P>
The Block Numbers must use leading zeros for blocks 1 through 5. The Rectangle
Number can not contain zeros for any of the values. If the complete three
digit Rectangle Number is unknown the trailing zeros can be replace with
the value 5 to obtain the location of the center of the next larger rectangle.
This however in creases the size of the area represented by the ACS.
<P>
Select the Input coordinates, datum and units in the boxes for your data
file and then press the "Run batch" button. Navigate to the file folder of
your file. Select it and press the "Open" button.
<P>
The output file created is an ASCII delimited text file called "convert.dat"
and is located in the same folder as the input file. The format for this
file is Id, Northing, Easting, Latitude (NAD83), Longitude (NAD83), Latitude
(NAD27), Longitude (NAD27), Atlas Sheet Coordinate, USGS Quadrangle Name.
Also created is a file called "problem.dat" which lists any points which
were not converted.

</H3>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The New Jersey Geological Survey (NJGS) developed a location
system, known as the New Jersey Atlas Sheet Coordinate System (ASCS)
(<A href="#refer">K&uuml;mmel, 1912, p.13 and K&uuml;mmel, 1913, p 13</A>).
The ASCS was designed to be easier to use and understand than the latitude
and longitude system.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The Atlas Sheets, on a scale of 1:63,360, or 1 inch per mile,
are the basis of the system. The sheets are numbered from 21 to 37, and are
divided into rectangles, each covering, 2 minutes of latitude and longitude.
Each Atlas Sheet spans 28 degrees of latitude and 26 degrees of longitude,
making 13 rectangles from east to west and 14 from north to south.</FONT>
<P>
<SMALL>Every third line of latitude and longitude delineates a 6-minute block,
for 16 complete blocks, each containing 9 smaller 2-minute rectangles. Beginning
in the upper left-hand corner, these blocks are numbered across the sheet
01 to 04. The blocks of the second row are numbered 11 to 14, those of the
third row 21 to 24, of the fourth row 31 to 34. </SMALL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><SMALL> </SMALL></FONT><SMALL>In addition to the 16 complete
6-minute blocks there is, along the right-hand side of the sheet, a single
row of 2-minute rectangles and along the bottom, a double row of 2-minute
rectangles. The incomplete blocks of the fifth row at the bottom, 41 to 44,
contain 6 of the 2-minute rectangles. The blocks along the right (vertical)
side (05, 15, 25, and 35) each contain 3 of the 2-minute rectangles. Block
45 in the lower right corner contains only 2 of the 2-minute rectangles.
The arrangement and numbering of these blocks form the primary divisions
of each atlas sheet. </SMALL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The nine 2-minute rectangles in each of the complete blocks
are numbered from 1 to 9, beginning in the upper left-hand corner, and numbered
to the right, 4 being on the left under 1. The subdivision of the rectangles
for the incomplete blocks at the right are numbered 1, 4, and 7; and those
at the bottom 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; and of block 45 in the lower right corner
1 and 4.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> A further subdivision of each of these rectangles into squares
and units is necessary in order to fix locations to an area of approximately
30 acres, and these subdivisions are likewise numbered 1 to 9.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> If the number of the atlas sheet is followed by the number
of each of these smaller divisions or units, each 30 acre parcel in the State
acquires a unique 7 digit number. The number enables any point to be located
quickly on any atlas sheet.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is impossible to map a curved Earth on a flat map using plane
coordinates (x,y or northing, easting) without distorting angles, distances,
or areas. It is possible to design a map projection such that some of the
three are undisturbed or minimally distorted. The State Plane Coordinate
System (SPCS) is a map projection system that minimizes angular distortions
if only a small portion of the earth is flattened out. Thus, the SPCS is
a rectangular (x,y or northing, easting) coordinate system describing geodetic
positions of a limited area (a state or a portion of it) on a plane. The
(x,y) coordinates are computed by projecting latitudes and longitudes from
a mathematical approximation of the earth (i.e., NAD83) onto a rectangular
grid. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>By law, the New Jersey State Plane Coordinate System (based
on NAD83) is the official survey base for the State of New Jersey
(R.S.51:3-7).</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The coordinate reference system North American Datum of 1927
(NAD27) was adopted in 1913 and is based on the Clarke reference ellipsoid.
The Geodetic survey station MEADES RANCH in Osborne County, Kansas, was selected
as the reference point for this datum. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With the development of global positioning system (GPS), the
capability was provided for obtaining more precise positional data. GPS data
was "forced" to fit the original NAD27 network, which caused distortions
in the positional data. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The development of the NAD83 included both a readjustment of
the survey observations and a redefinition of the datum. This new datum was
defined using the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) as the reference
ellipsoid. The GRS80 ellipsoid is geocentric and more closely approximates
the true size and shape of the Earth. A readjustment was also done using
a simultaneous least-squares method of adjustment to minimize mathematical
distortions. This x,y coordinate shift can exceed 400 meters in some parts
of the country.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Locations obtained using GPS receivers are in NAD83 as are Digital
Ortho Photo quads. Older digital data products such as US Geological Survey
(USGS) Digital Line Graph data (digital representation of features found
on USGS quad maps) are generally NAD27.</FONT>
